# Internet Direct Helper
This is a simple utility application that sits in the status bar and allows users to toggle their wifi, and manually open the InternetDirect login page when they are expeiencing session issues.

## Installation
Simply download the .app file and install it in your `/Applications` or `~/Applications` folder.

I'd also recommend adding the application to your `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items` list so that the helper starts when you log in.
